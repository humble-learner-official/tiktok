    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last Updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Humble Learner application ("the App", "we", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information. The App is designed as a private, automated utility for publishing video content directly to TikTok.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Because the App operates as a local automation tool, we collect minimal data. The App only requests the standard OAuth permissions required by the official TikTok API (such as <code>video.publish</code> and <code>user.info.basic</code>) to authenticate your account and facilitate video uploads. We do not harvest or store public user data.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The authentication tokens generated during the login process are used strictly to securely upload your video files to your connected TikTok account. We do not use this data for tracking, marketing, or any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your personal information or authentication tokens with third parties. Your use of this tool interacts directly with TikTok, meaning your data is also subject to TikTok's own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>All authentication tokens are processed locally on the machine running the automation script. We strongly advise keeping your host environment secure, as we cannot be responsible for unauthorized access to the machine where your scripts are executed.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
